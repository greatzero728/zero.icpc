Problem Analysis:
Given 5 x 5 0-1 grid, there is exactly one 1.
the minimum number of operations that move 1 into the middle point.

Algorithm:
get position of 1: i, j and then print(abs(i-3) + (j-3))

Key Points:
How to input the 5 x 5 grid.
a=[list(map(int,input().split())) for _ in range(5)]

if input is following:
n m
n x m gird
how to input?

Square brackets [] in Python are used to define a list.
Do you know what is a list comprehension?
A list comprehension is a compact way to create a list.

The general syntax is:
[expression for item in iterable]
This means:
Create a list by applying expression to each item in the iterable.

e.g., 
squares = [x**2 for x in range(5)]
print(squares)  # Output: [0, 1, 4, 9, 16]

How to generate n elements list that each element is 0?
grid = [0 for _ in range(7)]
print(grid)  # Output: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
