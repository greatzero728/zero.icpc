Problem Analysis:
n k
a1, a2, ... an
calculate the number of index i where ai >= ak and ai is positive.

Algorithm:
no algorithm.

Original code:
n,k=list(map(int,input().split()))
l=list(map(int,input().split()))
num=0
for i in l:
    if i>=l[k-1] and i>0:
        num+=1
print(num)


Key Points:
0-index: k-th element will be considered as (k-1)-th element.

how to use lambda:
n, k = map(int, input().split())
l = list(map(int, input().split()))
print(sum(map(lambda x: x >= l[k-1] and x > 0, l)))

Python is strong for short-code attribute, but I believe it's still valuable to write longer code.
The main focus should be that everyone should be able to read our code without any challenges.
