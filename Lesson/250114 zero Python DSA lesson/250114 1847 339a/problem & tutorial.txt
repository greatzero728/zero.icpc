Problem Analysis:
given addition expression only consists 1, 2, 3.
update the expression so that all elements are sorted in non-decreasing order.

Algorithm:
capture odd index elements.
sort.
insert '+' sign between them.
print.

Key Points:

`input_word[0::2]` means:

- Start at index `0` (first character).
- Go to the end of the string.
- Step by `2` (pick every second character).

This extracts all characters at even indices (0-based indexing).
